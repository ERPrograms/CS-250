Sprint Review and Retrospective
How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs, I try to focus on what the user is actually trying to accomplish instead of just the features they ask for. Breaking needs down into user stories helps because it puts the request in the user’s perspective: “As a [user], I want [feature], so that [benefit].” This structure keeps me focused on why the feature matters and makes it easier to translate those needs into clear program requirements.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

When I develop programs, I like to break the project into smaller, manageable tasks. This makes it easier to make steady progress and test along the way. Agile processes, like sprint planning, daily standups, and retrospectives, give structure to this approach. I especially value iteration, feedback, and continuous improvement. In my future work, I hope to continue using Agile to stay flexible, adapt to changes, and keep communication strong.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means communicating openly, being dependable, and respecting the perspectives of others. It’s not just about writing code—it’s about collaborating, sharing knowledge, and supporting the team so everyone succeeds. A good team member listens, helps solve problems, and contributes to a positive environment where the whole group can thrive.
